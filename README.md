# Paper - Dissecting the electoral support for the far right

In this Github repo you will find al the scripts used to write this paper. The repro contains 5 branches:

- Variable selection

In this branche you find the .sps files in which the data is prepared for analysis.

- Data joins

This is the R-script where the joins of ESS wave 7 and 8 are performed for the initial analysis and the robustness checks.

- model

In this branche the model is shown (.txt-format due to lack of accesability of STATA). This model is used for the initial model and the robustness check. Furthermore a R-script is present for the interaction of anti-immigration with the type of country (i.e. mature or post-communist country).

- AIC test

In this subsection the different theories are compared with use of Akaike information criterion (AIC).

- Robustness check

In this branche the R-script is stored in which the anti-immigration hypothesis is tested per country.
