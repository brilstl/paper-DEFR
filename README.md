# Paper - Dissecting the electoral support for the far right

In this Github repository you will find all the scripts used to write this paper. The repo contains 5 branches:

- Variable selection

In this branch you find the .sps files in which the data is prepared for analysis.

- Data joins

This is the R-script where the data of ESS waves 7 and 8 are joined together for the initial analysis and the robustness checks.

- Model

In this branch, the model is shown (.txt-format due to lack of accesability of STATA). This model is used for the initial analysis and the robustness checks. Furthermore, an R-script is present for the interaction of anti-immigration with the type of country (i.e. mature or post-communist country) (see fig. 1 in paper).

- AIC test

In this subsection the different theories are compared with the use of Akaike information criterion (AIC).

- Robustness check

In this branch, the R-script in which the anti-immigration hypothesis is tested per country is stored.
